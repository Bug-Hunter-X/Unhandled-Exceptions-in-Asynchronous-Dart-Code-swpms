# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart: forgetting to properly handle exceptions thrown during asynchronous operations. The `fetchData` function makes a network request; if the request fails, an exception is thrown.  However, simply catching the error without proper handling (e.g., providing feedback to the user, retrying the request, or logging it appropriately) can lead to unexpected application behavior.

The solution demonstrates the best practices, including informative error messages, re-throwing exceptions for higher-level handling, and utilizing `Future.catchError` for handling errors.
